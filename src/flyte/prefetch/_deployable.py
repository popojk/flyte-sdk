"""
A prefetch task that can be registered once and launched by anything.

`hf_model` builds its environment at call time and ships the task as a
cloudpickle bundle, which means only a Python process holding the SDK can start
a prefetch. That is the right shape for a notebook or a CLI, and the wrong shape
for a control plane: a console button has no Python to run.

So this module declares the same work as an ordinary registered task. Deployed
once into a system project, it is addressable by name and version like any other
task, and a backend can bind it to a run in the user's own project -- which is
how the remote image builder's `build-image` task already works.

Both paths converge on `store_hf_model_task`, so there is one implementation of
prefetching and two ways to reach it.

Not imported from `flyte.prefetch`'s `__init__`: importing prefetch eagerly at
the `flyte` level has been a problem before, and this module is only ever
imported by the deploy driver.

    Prefetch a HuggingFace model into a model artifact.

    Registered as `prefetch.hf_model` -- `TaskEnvironment` prefixes task
    names with the environment's name.

    Flat strings with `""` for unset, rather than `str | None`: an optional
    becomes a union literal, which is awkward to construct from a non-Python
    caller, and every input has to be sent explicitly anyway because CreateRun
    does not apply a task's declared defaults. Neither field can legitimately be
    empty, so `""` is unambiguous.

    The remaining fields of `HuggingFaceModelInfo` are intentionally absent:
    architecture, model type, task and modality are all read from the model's
    own config, so asking a caller for them invites a wrong answer.

    Args:
        repo: HuggingFace repository id, e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`.
        artifact_name: Name to publish under. Empty derives it from the repo's
            last path segment with `.` replaced by `-`.
        short_description: Free-text description for the artifact.

    Returns:
        The directory holding the model, published as a model artifact whose
        version is the HuggingFace commit.
