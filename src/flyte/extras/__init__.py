Flyte extras package.
This package provides various utilities that make it possible to build highly customized workflows.

1. ContainerTask: Execute arbitrary pre-containerized applications, without needing the `flyte-sdk`
                  to be installed. This extra uses `flyte copilot` system to inject inputs and slurp
                  outputs from the container run.

2. DynamicBatcher / TokenBatcher: Maximize resource utilization by batching work from many concurrent
                   producers through a single async processing function.  DynamicBatcher is the
                   general-purpose base; TokenBatcher is a convenience subclass for token-budgeted
                   LLM inference with reusable containers.

3. Sleep: Route a task to the backend `core-sleep` plugin, which executes in leaseworker with no
                   task pod.

4. Shell: Wrap a CLI tool packaged in a container image. Designed as the foundation for
                bio module libraries (bedtools, samtools, bcftools, GATK, etc.) and any other case
                where a user wants to call a pre-built binary in a published container with
                typed inputs and outputs.
