"""
Wall-clock bounds on a Flyte action.

Three orthogonal fields, each independently optional. A field is treated as
**unlimited** when it is unset (`None`) or zero (`0` / `timedelta(0)`) —
the default state of an action is "no time bound."

- `max_runtime`     — wall-clock spent in the RUNNING phase. Per attempt;
                        resets on each retry. Enforced by the lease worker.
- `max_queued_time` — wall-clock spent in QUEUED + WAITING_FOR_RESOURCES
                        before the action enters INITIALIZING. Per attempt;
                        resets on each retry. Maps to proto
                        `TimeoutStrategy.queued_timeout`.
- `deadline`        — max elapsed wall-clock from the first QUEUED timestamp
                        to a terminal phase, across **all** attempts (user *or*
                        system). One-time, absolute. The strongest of the
                        three: when it fires mid-attempt, the action terminates
                        as TIMED_OUT regardless of remaining retry budget or
                        per-attempt timer state.

Bare `int` (seconds) and bare `timedelta` are accepted on the task
`timeout=` parameter and interpreted as `max_runtime`. `timeout=0` is
equivalent to leaving the timeout unset (unlimited).
