"""MCP tool implementations for `flyte.ai.mcp.FlyteMCPAppEnvironment`.

The tools live here rather than in `_flyte_mcp_app.py` purely for size: the environment
module owns configuration, the tool registry and registration, this one owns the bodies.
Every tool closes over the environment (`env`) for its allowlists, search paths and the
per-call project/domain scoping, so they are built by `build_tool_functions` rather
than defined at module level.

Each function's docstring is what the MCP client shows the model, so they are written for an
agent audience: when to reach for the tool, and what it hands back.
