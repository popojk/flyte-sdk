"""Code-mode helpers for `flyte.ai.agents.Agent`.

In *code mode* the agent does not emit JSON tool calls. Instead, on each turn the
LLM writes a short Python program that is executed in the Monty sandbox
(`flyte.sandbox.orchestrate_local`). The agent's tools are exposed to that
sandbox as plain functions. Tools with a `call_handler` are wrapped so the
handler runs on each sandbox invocation (same as the tool-calling path).
`@env.task` tools without a handler are passed through as their underlying
template so they dispatch durably on the cluster; `@flyte.trace` helpers are
traced, and `flyte_map(...)` fans out in parallel — all the usual Flyte
features, driven by generated code.

This module is internal: the public surface is the `code_mode` flag on
`flyte.ai.agents.Agent`.
