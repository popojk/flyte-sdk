"""
Helpers for resolving `Environment.include` entries into absolute paths suitable
for the code bundler.

Relative paths are anchored at the directory of each environment's
`_declaring_file` (the user file where the env was instantiated), matching the
convention established by `AppEnvironment`. Absolute paths pass through
unchanged. Directories and glob patterns are deferred to `ls_relative_files`
downstream — this module only resolves strings into absolute form.
