Code bundling — package user source into an artifact a remote worker can
download and run.

When a task runs on a remote cluster, its Python files need to get from the
developer's machine into the container. This module does that packaging.
It takes a source directory plus a few knobs, produces a versioned,
content-addressed archive, uploads it, and hands back a `flyte.models.CodeBundle`
handle that the backend attaches to the task spec.

## The bundle

A `flyte.models.CodeBundle` is exactly one of:

* **tgz** — a gzipped tarball of source files. The common case.

  Archive members use POSIX-relative paths (so a file at
  `<from_dir>/utils/helper.py` becomes `utils/helper.py` in the tar),
  mtimes and uid/gid are stripped so the output is byte-deterministic, and
  the tarball filename is `fast<digest>.tar.gz` where `<digest>` is
  the md5 over the sorted list of `(file-content, POSIX-relative-path)`
  pairs. The digest is the bundle's `computed_version`, so two
  identical layouts in different parent directories produce the same
  bundle filename and version.

* **pkl** — a cloudpickle of the in-memory `TaskTemplate` or
  `AppEnvironment`, gzipped. Used when there is no single user file to
  walk (Jupyter, REPL). The file is `code_bundle.pkl.gz`; its version
  is the md5 of the gzipped bytes.

Either way the result is small, versioned, and self-contained.

## What goes into a tgz bundle

Files are selected by `copy_style`:

`"loaded_modules"` (default)
    Walk `sys.modules` and keep only modules whose `__file__` sits
    under `from_dir` (and not under site-packages or the stdlib). The
    bundle contains only Python files the current process actually
    imported — unused siblings never ship.

`"all"`
    Walk `from_dir` on disk and include every file that is not excluded
    by `.gitignore` or the standard ignore list (`__pycache__`,
    `*.pyc`, `.venv`, `.git`, …). Use when the task needs files it
    doesn't import — data, configs, templates, binary assets.

`"none"`
    Discover nothing from disk. Only meaningful when the caller also
    passes `Environment.include` — otherwise there is nothing to ship
    and the builder raises.

`"custom"`
    Don't discover; bundle an explicit caller-supplied list of relative
    paths. Used by the CLI when it has already determined the minimal
    file set.

On top of that, `Environment.include` contributes extra paths that are
unioned into whatever `copy_style` discovered. Includes are resolved
relative to the file where the environment was declared, deduplicated
across environments, and must live under `from_dir`.

## Public API

* `flyte._code_bundle.build_code_bundle` — walk `from_dir` using `copy_style`,
  tar+gzip, upload, return a tgz `flyte.models.CodeBundle`. The main entry
  point.
* `flyte._code_bundle.build_code_bundle_from_relative_paths` — bundle an explicit list
  of relative paths (no discovery). Used for the includes-only case and
  for `copy_style="custom"`.
* `flyte._code_bundle.build_pkl_bundle` — cloudpickle the task/app in memory and
  upload. Returns a pkl `flyte.models.CodeBundle`.
* `flyte._code_bundle.download_bundle` — the counterpart that runs on the worker:
  fetch the tgz/pkl and extract it into the task's working directory.
