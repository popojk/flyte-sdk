"""Report tracked-run state to the control plane via `TrackedRunService`.

`RemoteRunReporter` is a third `RunRecorder`
backend (next to the TUI tracker and the SQLite `RunStore`).

Why the facade is synchronous when the SDK is async-first: the `RunRecorder`
observer contract is synchronous by design and fires from async controller code
*and* from the worker threads that run synchronous tasks — there is no single
event loop the reporter could await on, and a recorder call must never block or
fail the run it is observing. So every `record_*` call only captures a
lightweight, fully-computed event and enqueues it on a thread-safe queue. All
actual I/O is async: a dedicated background worker thread hosts its own event
loop (the same shape as `flyte.syncify`'s `_BackgroundLoop` and the remote
controller's worker model) and runs the async pipeline there — batching queued
events into `TrackedRunService.ReportActions` calls on the async client and
performing the outputs/report signed-URL uploads for terminal events. The
dedicated loop also keeps the terminal flush working during interpreter
shutdown and `KeyboardInterrupt`, when the caller's loop may already be gone.
Async callers can use `aclose`; `close` is the sync barrier used at
process-exit points.

Reporting is strictly best-effort: enqueue methods never raise, the worker retries a
bounded number of times and then drops the batch with a warning, and the terminal
flush (`close`) waits a bounded amount of time so
`flyte run --local` never hangs on a slow control plane.
