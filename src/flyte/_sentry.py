    captive portal, corporate TLS interceptor or misrouted ingress absorbed it and
    answered on the backend's behalf:

    1. A *success* status that is not 200 (204 No Content, 202 Accepted, ...).
       FLYTE-SDK-77 / FLYTE-SDK-78: `flyte run` and `flyte deploy` from a Windows
       host got `ConnectError: No Content` out of CreateUploadLocation and
       SelectCluster, surfaced as `RuntimeSystemError: Upload failed for ...`.
    2. A `text/*` content-type. FLYTE-SDK-7A / FLYTE-SDK-6P:
       `invalid content-type: 'text/html'; expecting 'application/proto'` — an HTML
       page where a protobuf body belongs. `_client_config.py` already treats this
       exact signature as a misconfigured endpoint (#1235) when it comes back from
       the auth metadata fetch; these are the same thing arriving on a data-plane
       call instead.

    Either way it is endpoint/network configuration, never a Python-SDK logic bug,

    Deliberately narrow on both counts. connectrpc synthesizes the same shape of
    error — Code.UNKNOWN, no details, message == a bare HTTP reason phrase — for
    *any* unmapped status, including 500 ("Internal Server Error"). Those stay
    reported: a 500 means something genuinely broke and is worth tracking
    (FLYTE-SDK-64 and friends are exactly that, and are real backend signal). Only
    the 2xx class is unambiguously "an intermediary answered instead of the
    backend". Likewise only `text/*` is filtered on content-type, so an
    `application/*` mismatch — which would point at a codec bug on our side —
