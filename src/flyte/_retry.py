"""
Retry policy for Flyte tasks.

A retry is a fresh attempt at executing a failed action. `RetryStrategy.count`
is the number of *user* retries; system retries (network, container, k8s) are
governed by the platform and are not subject to this policy.

User retries can be paced by an optional `flyte.Backoff` policy. Without a
backoff, retries fire back-to-back. With a backoff, the n-th retry (0-indexed)
is delayed by `min(base * factor**n, cap)`.

Retries are *not* triggered when user code raises
`flyte.errors.NonRecoverableError` — that exception is the explicit
opt-out: "this failure is terminal, do not retry, even if attempts remain."
