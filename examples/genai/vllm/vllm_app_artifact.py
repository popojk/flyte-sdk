"""
Serve a prefetched HuggingFace model from its **artifact**, using vLLM.

This is the artifact-bound counterpart to `vllm_app.py`. Instead of pointing the
app at a specific run (`flyte.app.RunOutput(run_name=...)`), the app declares the
model it wants by *artifact name*:

```python
model_path=flyte.app.ArtifactValue(name="SmolLM2-135M-Instruct", type="directory")
```

Why that matters: `flyte.prefetch.hf_model()` publishes a model artifact whose
name is the repo tail and whose version is the HuggingFace commit id. Binding to
the artifact name means the app definition is complete at module scope — it is
deployable with a plain `flyte deploy`, with no run name to thread through — and
the resolved artifact version is recorded, so the platform links this app to the
exact model version it is serving.

The model is `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` (135M params, ~270MB bf16),
the smallest checkpoint that satisfies both ends of this pipeline:

- prefetch requires **safetensors** weights (the streaming serving loader reads
  nothing else), which rules out e.g. `facebook/opt-125m`;
- vLLM requires a resolvable `architectures` entry in config.json, which rules
  out the sub-1MB `hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-gpt2`.

SmolLM2-135M is `LlamaForCausalLM` with head_dim 64 and a chat template, so it
loads on any attention backend and answers on the OpenAI-compatible route.

Step 1 — prefetch the model (publishes the artifact)
----------------------------------------------------

```
python examples/genai/vllm/vllm_app_artifact.py
```

The repo is public, so `hf_token_key=None` prefetches anonymously — no HF_TOKEN
secret required. Inspect what was published with:

```
flyte get artifact SmolLM2-135M-Instruct
```

Step 2 — deploy the app
-----------------------

```
flyte deploy examples/genai/vllm/vllm_app_artifact.py smollm2_app
```

`ArtifactValue` is resolved at deploy time: `version=None` picks the latest
version and pins the app to it, so a later re-prefetch of a new HF commit does
not silently swap the weights under a running app. Redeploy to move forward.

Usage
-----

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="<your-app-endpoint>/v1", api_key="<your-api-key>")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="smollm2-135m",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain what a Flyte artifact is, briefly."}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
