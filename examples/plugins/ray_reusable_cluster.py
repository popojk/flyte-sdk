"""Reusable shared Ray cluster.

A driver task spawns two Ray tasks concurrently. Because both Ray tasks belong to the same
environment declared with ``flyte.ReusePolicy``, they run on ONE long-lived, shared RayCluster
instead of each paying a full cluster cold-start: the first task to arrive creates the cluster,
the second reuses it. The cluster is shut down automatically once it has been idle for ``idle_ttl``
seconds.
