"""Registering agento11y's framework handlers with the agents plugin.

Every agento11y integration exposes the same shape: a `with_agento11y_*` function that
takes the framework's native run payload and returns it with a handler attached. That lines
up exactly with the instrumentor contract in `flyteplugins.agents.core`, so wiring the two
together is a table rather than six bespoke integrations.

The reason this indirection exists at all is that the adapters own the framework call. A
LangChain callback or an OpenAI Agents `RunHooks` has to be passed at invocation time, and
a user driving an agent through `run_agent` has nowhere to put one. The adapter offers its
payload to the registry on the way past and this module is what answers.
