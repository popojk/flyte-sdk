"""Giving agento11y the Flyte identifiers it already has slots for.

agento11y groups its records by conversation, and tracks which agent and which version
produced them. Flyte knows all three, and nobody should have to restate them by hand:

    conversation id  <-  the run
    agent name       <-  the task
    agent version    <-  the task version

    The agent name binding assumes one agent per task. A task driving several agents should
    set `bind_agent_name=False` so each keeps the name its framework gave it.

Binding them means a Flyte run shows up in Grafana as one conversation, and a redeploy shows
up as a new agent version, so the before-and-after of a prompt change is directly comparable.

This is a `flyte._observe.Observer` which is what makes it work at all: the values
have to be set for the duration of the task body, before any generation starts, and that is
exactly the window a task span covers.
