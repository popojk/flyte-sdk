"""A durable agent that crashes, resumes and stays one trace in Grafana.

This is the part Grafana cannot see on its own. A run that crashes and resumes is several
processes over time, each with a fresh SDK. Left alone, each attempt starts its own trace,
and every step the resumed run replayed out of its durable log is missing entirely, because
replayed steps never execute and so nothing instruments them.

With the plugin, the trace id is derived from the run, so both attempts record into one
trace; replayed steps appear marked flyte.replayed; and the generations already paid for on
the first attempt are not paid for again, because flyte.trace replays them from the log.

Run it once and it fails partway. Resume the same run and watch the trace fill in.
