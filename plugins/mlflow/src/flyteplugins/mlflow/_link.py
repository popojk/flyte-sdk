@dataclass
class Mlflow(Link):
    """MLflow UI link for Flyte tasks.

    Resolves the link URL from one of two sources (in priority order):

    1. **Explicit link** — set at definition or override time:

    ```python
    @env.task(links=[Mlflow(link="https://mlflow.example.com/...")])

    task.override(links=[Mlflow(link="https://...")])()
    ```

    2. **Context link** — auto-generated from `link_host` (and optional
       `link_template`) set via `mlflow_config()`. Propagates to child
       tasks that share or nest under the parent's run. Cleared when a task
       creates an independent run (`run_mode="new"`). For nested runs
       (`run_mode="nested"`), the parent link is kept and the link name
       is automatically set to "MLflow (parent)".
