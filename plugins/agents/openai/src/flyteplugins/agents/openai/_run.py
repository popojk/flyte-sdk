    """Run an OpenAI Agents SDK agent with Flyte providing the runtime.

    Await this from an async task as `await run_agent(...)`; from a sync task
    use `flyteplugins.agents.openai.run_agent_sync` instead.

    Call this from inside an `@env.task` — that task is the durable parent.
    Within it, each model turn is recorded via `flyte.trace` (replayed on
    retry) and each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action. Give the
    enclosing task `retries=...` for self-healing and `report=True` to see
    the agent timeline.

    Provide either a fully-built `agent` (keeping its handoffs/guardrails), or
    `tools` + `instructions` + `model` to have one built for you. `tools`
    may be `flyteplugins.agents.openai.tool`-wrapped tools or bare `@env.task` templates
    (wrapped automatically).

    Args:
        input: The user prompt (or a list of input items).
        agent: A pre-built `agents.Agent`. Mutually exclusive with `tools`.
        tools: Tools to expose (when `agent` is not given).
        model: Model name (when `agent` is not given).
        instructions: System instructions (when `agent` is not given).
        name: Agent name (when `agent` is not given).
        max_turns: Maximum model to tool turns and vice versa before the SDK raises.
        durable: Record/replay each model turn via `flyte.trace`.
        observability: Render the run timeline into the Flyte task report.
        run_config: A custom `RunConfig`; `model_provider` is wrapped for
            durability unless `durable=False`.
        hooks: Your own `RunHooks`. Any registered instrumentor is offered these, so an
            observability handler chains onto yours rather than displacing them.
        memory_key: Stable id (e.g. a user/thread id) for cross-run memory.
            When set, conversation history is loaded from and saved to a durable,
            keyed `MemoryStore` (via the SDK's `Session`), so a later run with
            the same key continues the conversation. `None` disables memory.

    Returns:
        The agent's final output as a string.
