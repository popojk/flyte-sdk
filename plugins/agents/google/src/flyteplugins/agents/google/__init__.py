"""Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) adapter for Flyte.

Bring your own `google-adk` agent and run it durably on Flyte. ADK's `Runner`
owns the loop; Flyte is the runtime underneath: the tools you expose are Flyte tasks
(durable child actions), each model turn is recorded for replay (`durable=True`),
the run timeline renders into the task report, and `memory_key` gives cross-run
conversation memory.

- `flyteplugins.agents.google.tool` — turn an `@env.task` into a Google ADK tool.
- `flyteplugins.agents.google.run_agent` — run the ADK agent loop inside your task and return the answer.
- `flyteplugins.agents.google.durable_model` — wrap a model so its turns are durable, for hand-built agent
  trees (e.g. sub-agent transfers) passed to `run_agent` via `agent=`.

Set the model provider's API key in the environment (e.g. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for
Gemini) — wire it as a Flyte secret.
