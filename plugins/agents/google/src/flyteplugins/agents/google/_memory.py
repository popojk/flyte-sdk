"""Cross-run memory for Google ADK — persist and restore the session transcript.

ADK keeps the conversation as a list of `Event`s on the session. For cross-run
memory we persist those events to a keyed `MemoryStore` and replay them into a
fresh session on the next run, so the agent continues the conversation. Keyed by a
stable `memory_key` (a user/thread id); best-effort and never fatal.
