"""Letting an out-of-tree observability package instrument the frameworks adapters drive.

Instrumentation libraries for agent frameworks generally work by being handed something at
the call site: a callback list for LangChain, a `RunHooks` for OpenAI Agents, options for
the Claude Agent SDK. That is a problem here because the adapter owns the call. A user who
wants their agent instrumented has nowhere to put the handler since the invocation happens
inside our code rather than theirs.

So adapters offer the framework-native payload here on the way past, and anything registered
gets a chance to return a modified one. `flyteplugins-agento11y` is the first registrant.
This module deliberately knows nothing about any observability vendor: it moves an opaque
object through a function and keeps the agents plugin free of those dependencies.

Adapters call `apply_instrumentation` at the invocation site:

    config = apply_instrumentation("langgraph", config)
    result = await agent.ainvoke(state, config=config)

With nothing registered this returns the payload unchanged, so the ordinary path is a dict
lookup and nothing else.
