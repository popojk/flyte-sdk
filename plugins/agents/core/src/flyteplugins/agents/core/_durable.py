"""Durable, replayable steps via `flyte.trace` — the shared mechanism.

A model turn (or any expensive, replay-worthy call) is recorded as a
`flyte.trace` leaf so that, inside a Flyte task, a crash/retry replays the
recorded result instead of re-running it. The real call is usually
non-serializable (closures, SDK objects), but `flyte.trace` keys its memo on
the decorated function's serializable arguments. `flyteplugins.agents.core.durable_step` resolves
that by capturing the real call in a closure and feeding the trace only a
deterministic `request_key`.

    inline and is human-readable in the Flyte UI) and rebuilt with `loads` on
    the way out and on replay.
