"""Cross-run agent memory — a thin handle over Flyte's keyed `MemoryStore`.

"Agent memory" = durable state addressable by a stable `memory_key` (a user or
thread id), shared across runs and workers. We don't reinvent it: Flyte already
ships a keyed, blob-store-backed store (`flyte.ai.agents.memory.MemoryStore`)
that resolves a deterministic remote path from the key and the active run context
— stripping the per-run scratch so two runs with the same key share one store,
and encapsulating all the storage details.

It is decoupled from the agent loop - importing it does not pull in any agent
harness — so adapters use it purely as a durable store. Each adapter then maps its
SDK's own conversation state onto the returned store.

The store carries two complementary surfaces, so one `memory_key` covers both
kinds of memory:

- `messages` (`append`/`extend`) — the conversation transcript;
- path-addressed `read_json`/`write_json`/`list_paths` — durable named facts
  (the `remember` / `recall` substrate), with audit + version history.
