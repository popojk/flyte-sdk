"""Conformance harness — enforce the common adapter format.

Every `flyteplugins.agents.<sdk>` adapter ships a one-line test:

```python
from flyteplugins.agents.core.testing import assert_adapter_conforms
import flyteplugins.agents.openai as adapter

def test_conformance():
    assert_adapter_conforms(adapter)
```

CI then fails if an adapter drifts from the shared format.
