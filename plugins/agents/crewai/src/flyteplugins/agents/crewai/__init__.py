"""CrewAI adapter for Flyte.

Bring your own CrewAI `Agent` and run it durably on Flyte. The adapter
provides:

- `flyteplugins.agents.crewai.tool` — turn a Flyte `@env.task` into a CrewAI tool that executes as
  a durable child action (own container/GPU, retries, caching).
- `flyteplugins.agents.crewai.run_agent` — run the CrewAI agent loop inside your task and return the
  final answer.

Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action, and the run timeline is
rendered into the Flyte task report.
