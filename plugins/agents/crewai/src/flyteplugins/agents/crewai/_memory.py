"""Cross-run CrewAI memory — a thin handle over Flyte's keyed `MemoryStore`.

CrewAI keeps conversation state in-memory and `kickoff_async` does not thread a
prior transcript back out (its `LiteAgentOutput.messages` holds only the
system+user turns of the current call, not the assistant reply). So this module
maintains the transcript itself: it resolves a keyed `MemoryStore` and stores
the running conversation — a list of `{"role", "content"}` dicts — in a
path-addressed JSON slot. A later run with the same `memory_key` loads that
transcript and prepends it to the new prompt, continuing the conversation.

Everything here is best-effort: a store that can't be resolved, or a read/write
that fails, degrades to a memoryless run rather than breaking it.
