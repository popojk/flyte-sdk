"""Durable, replayable model turns for CrewAI.

CrewAI owns the agent loop and drives the model itself: during
`Agent.kickoff_async` it calls its `crewai.LLM` once per turn. To make that
loop durable we swap in a durable `LLM`: it records each turn through the
shared `flyteplugins.agents.core.durable_step` (a `flyte.trace` leaf),
so inside a Flyte task a crashed/retried run replays completed turns from their
recorded completions instead of re-calling (and re-billing) the model. Tool
calls run as durable child actions (see `flyteplugins.agents.crewai.tool`),
so the whole run becomes crash-resilient when the enclosing task carries
`retries=...`.

Two CrewAI facts shape the implementation:

- `crewai.LLM(model=...)` is a *factory*: `LLM.__new__` dispatches on the
  model name and returns a provider-specific subclass (`OpenAICompletion`,
  `AnthropicCompletion`, ...). A plain `class D(LLM)` therefore never sees the
  provider's real `call`. We instead subclass the *concrete* provider class of a
  probe instance (`type(LLM(model=...))`) and instantiate through it, so the
  durable overrides sit directly on top of the real completion methods.
- `kickoff_async` invokes the **synchronous** `call` (verified on 1.15.2),
  not `acall`; we override both so durability applies whichever path runs.

The turn result is the completion — a string, a *list of tool calls*, or an
arbitrary object for structured outputs. CrewAI's default executor
(`crewai.experimental.agent_executor.AgentExecutor`) does native tool calling:
a tool-calling turn returns the raw OpenAI-SDK `ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall`
objects, and the executor's router only treats the turn as tool calls when the
list elements still carry a `function` attribute (or a `"function"` dict key).
`durable_step` round-trips every result through `dumps`/`loads` even on the
recording pass, so tool-call lists must be serialized to a typed record and
rebuilt faithfully — coercing them to strings makes the router fall through and
return the stringified calls as the final answer, silently ending the run after
one turn. Strings round-trip as-is; tool-call lists round-trip through their own
tagged record; other structured results are recorded as JSON and rebuilt as
plain data (a lossy but safe fallback). The concrete provider class is a heavy
import, so the durable subclass is built lazily on first use.
