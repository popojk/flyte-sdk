"""`run_agent` — run a CrewAI agent on Flyte.

CrewAI owns the agent loop (it drives the model + tools). `run_agent` runs that
loop inside your `@env.task`: it builds an agent with Flyte-task tools, drives
the agent via `Agent.kickoff_async`, and returns the final answer. Each tool
call runs as a durable Flyte child action (its own container/resources, with
retries and caching).

Observability: the run timeline — tool calls and AI message turns — is rendered
into the Flyte task report.

The adapter minimizes delta between native CrewAI code and Flyte integration by
exposing tools that are drop-in `crewai.tools.BaseTool` instances.

    """Run a CrewAI agent with the given tools and prompt; return the final text.

    Await this from an async task as `await run_agent(...)`; from a sync task
    use `flyteplugins.agents.crewai.run_agent_sync` instead.

    Call this from inside an `@env.task` — that task is the durable parent.
    Within it, each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action. Give the
    enclosing task `retries=...` for self-healing and `report=True` to see
    the agent timeline.

    Provide either a pre-built `agent` (with its own tools already attached) or
    `tools` + `model` to have one built for you — not both.

    Args:
        input: The user prompt.
        tools: `tool`-wrapped tools or bare `@env.task` templates. Attached
            natively to the built `Agent(tools=...)`. Ignored when `agent` is
            given (a pre-built agent carries its own tools).
        model: Model name (e.g. `"gpt-4o"`) for the built agent. Required on
            the builder path (no default is assumed — the adapter is provider
            agnostic); ignored when a pre-built `agent` is given.
        instructions: Extra guidance folded into the built agent's backstory.
        agent: A pre-built CrewAI `Agent`. Mutually exclusive with `tools`.
        name: Agent name (for debugging/observability).
        durable: Record/replay each model turn via `flyte.trace`. Applied only
            when `run_agent` builds the agent (the builder sets a durable
            `llm`); a pre-built `agent` keeps its own `llm` and is not
            rewrapped, so its turns are not durable.
        observability: Render the run timeline into the Flyte task report.
        memory_key: Stable id (e.g. a user/thread id) for cross-run memory.
            When set, conversation history is persisted to a keyed `MemoryStore`
            and resumed on a later run with the same key.
        **run_kwargs: Additional kwargs forwarded to `Agent.kickoff_async`.

    Returns:
        The agent's final output as a string.
