"""Cross-run LangChain memory — a thin bridge over Flyte's keyed `MemoryStore`.

LangChain's `create_agent` graph is driven with a messages state
(`graph.ainvoke({"messages": [...]})`) and, by default, keeps no state across
runs. This module bridges that: it resolves a keyed `flyte.ai.agents.MemoryStore`, loads a
prior conversation from a path-addressed JSON slot, and writes the full
transcript back after the run — so a later run with the same `memory_key`
continues the conversation.

The transcript is stored as `messages_to_dict(...)` output (the same
serialization the langgraph adapter uses) in a single JSON slot, and rebuilt with
`messages_from_dict`. All operations are best-effort: any failure leaves the run
untouched (memory never breaks a run).
