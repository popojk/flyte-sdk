"""LangChain adapter for Flyte.

Bring your own LangChain agent and run it durably on Flyte. The adapter provides:

- `flyteplugins.agents.langchain.tool` — turn a Flyte `@env.task` into a LangChain `StructuredTool`
  (a `BaseTool`) that executes as a durable child action (own container/GPU,
  retries, caching).
- `flyteplugins.agents.langchain.run_agent` — run the LangChain agent (a compiled `create_agent` graph)
  inside your task and return the final answer. Either pass a pre-built `agent`
  or let it build one from `tools` + `model` + `instructions`.

Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action, and the run timeline is
rendered into the Flyte task report.
