"""`run_agent` — run a LangChain agent on Flyte.

LangChain's agent framework owns the loop. `run_agent` runs that loop inside your
`@env.task`: it builds an agent (a compiled LangGraph graph) with Flyte-task tools,
drives it, and returns the final answer. Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child
action (its own container/resources, with retries and caching).

In langchain 1.x the agent is built with ``langchain.agents.create_agent(model, tools,
system_prompt=...)``, which returns a compiled graph that is driven with a messages
state: `await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": input}]})`, and
the final text is `result["messages"][-1].content`.

Observability: the run timeline is rendered into the Flyte task report.

The adapter minimizes delta between native LangChain code and Flyte integration by
exposing tools that are drop-in `BaseTool` instances.

    Await this from an async task as `await run_agent(...)`; from a sync task
    use `flyteplugins.agents.langchain.run_agent_sync` instead.

    Call this from inside an `@env.task` — that task is the durable parent.
    Within it, each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action. Give the
    enclosing task `retries=...` for self-healing and `report=True` to see
    the agent timeline.

    Provide either a pre-built `agent` (a compiled graph from `create_agent`)
    or `tools` + `model` to have one built for you.

    Args:
        input: The user prompt.
        tools: `tool`-wrapped tools or bare `@env.task` templates.
        model: A LangChain-compatible chat model (e.g.
            `ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")`). Required when `agent` is not
            given — one is built using this model.
        instructions: System prompt for the built agent.
        agent: A pre-built LangChain agent (a compiled `create_agent` graph).
            Mutually exclusive with `tools`.
        name: Agent name (for debugging/observability).
        durable: Record/replay each model turn via `flyte.trace`. Applies when
            a model is being built (`tools` + `model`, or a caller-passed
            `BaseChatModel`) — the model is wrapped in `DurableChatModel`.
            A fully pre-built compiled `agent` cannot be rewrapped, so its model
            turns are not made durable (its tool calls remain durable regardless).
        observability: Render the run timeline into the Flyte task report.
        memory_key: Stable id (e.g. a user/thread id) for cross-run memory.
            When set, conversation history is persisted to a keyed `MemoryStore`
            and resumed on a later run with the same key.
        config: A LangChain `RunnableConfig` forwarded to the graph's `ainvoke` — your
            own callbacks, tags, or metadata. Any registered instrumentor is offered this
            config, so an observability handler is appended to your callbacks rather than
            replacing them.
        **agent_kwargs: Additional kwargs forwarded to `create_agent`.

        The agent's final output as a string.
