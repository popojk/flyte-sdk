"""Mistral Agents adapter for Flyte (mistralai 2.x).

Bring your own Mistral agent and run it durably on Flyte. Tools you
expose are Flyte tasks (each call a durable child action), and each model turn is
recorded via `flyte.trace` (the turns are in-process HTTP calls, so we can trace
the seam below the SDK's loop) for per-turn replay on retry.

- `flyteplugins.agents.mistral.tool` — turn an `@env.task` into a Mistral run-framework tool.
- `flyteplugins.agents.mistral.run_agent` — run the SDK's agent loop inside your task; return the answer.
