"""`run_agent` — run a Mistral agent.

Durability via the seam below the loop: `run_async` makes each model turn by
calling `self.start_async`/`self.append_async` on the conversations object.
When `durable=True` we wrap those two methods so each turn is recorded via
`durable_step` (a `flyte.trace` leaf) — so a crash/retry replays completed
turns from their recorded `ConversationResponse` and completed tool calls are
cache hits.

The same seam also drives observability: the SDK's `RunResult` exposes no token
usage, but each turn's `ConversationResponse` does — so the wrapper tallies the
model-turn count + token usage and we render it as a summary row in the report. On a
retry, turns served from their durable record are counted as cached tokens so the row
shows they weren't re-billed (rather than passing a free replay off as fresh spend).

The API key is read from the environment — wire it as a Flyte secret.

    Await this from an async task as `await run_agent(...)`; from a sync task

    Call this from inside an `@env.task` — that task is the durable parent.
    The Mistral SDK runs the agent loop; each tool the agent calls runs as a
    durable Flyte child action, and (with `durable=True`) each model turn is
    recorded for replay. Pass `agent_id` to drive a pre-created server-side
    agent instead of an inline `model`.

    Args:
        input: The user prompt.
        tools: `tool`-wrapped tools or bare `@env.task` templates.
        model: Model for an inline run (when `agent_id` is not given).
        instructions: System instructions.
        timeout_ms: Per-turn request timeout (ms), applied by the SDK to each model
            call inside its loop; `None` uses the SDK default. This bounds a single
            hung turn — it is not a whole-run cap (Mistral exposes no turn-count
            limit). To bound the entire agent run, set `timeout=` on the enclosing
            `@env.task` (the durable parent), which caps all turns + tool calls.
        durable: Record/replay each conversation turn via `flyte.trace`.
        observability: Render the run timeline into the Flyte task report.
        agent_id: Reuse an existing server-side agent (instead of `model`).
        api_key_env_var: Env var holding the Mistral API key (wire as a secret).
        memory_key: Stable id (e.g. a user/thread id) for cross-run memory.
            When set, the thread's server-side `conversation_id` is persisted in a
            keyed `MemoryStore` and reused, so a later run with the same key
            continues the conversation. `None` disables memory.
