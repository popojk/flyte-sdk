"""Durable Claude sessions — make `durable=True` real via the SDK's session store.

The Claude Agent SDK runs the model loop inside the Claude Code CLI subprocess, so
there is no in-process model-call seam to wrap in `flyte.trace` for per-turn replay.
Instead we use the SDK's own session mirror + resume: the CLI mirrors the running
transcript to a `SessionStore` we provide, and on a retry it resumes from that store
rather than starting over.

We back that store with `flyte.Checkpoint` — the native, retry-surviving
durable prefix the runtime hands each task (`save` writes this attempt's blob,
`load` restores the previous attempt's). So a crashed attempt's conversation is
restored on the next attempt instead of replayed from scratch, without us owning
the loop.

Mapping to Flyte primitives:
- session id is derived deterministically from the task's `ActionID`, so every
  retry of the same action targets the same session;
- persistence is `flyte.Checkpoint` — durable across container restarts.
