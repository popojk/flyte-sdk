"""Claude Agent SDK adapter for Flyte.

Bring your own `claude-agent-sdk` agent and run it durably on Flyte. Tools you
expose are Flyte tasks (so each tool call is a durable child action with its own
container/resources, retries and caching); the agent loop itself runs in the
Claude Code runtime, and its timeline is rendered into the Flyte task report.

- `flyteplugins.agents.claude.tool` — turn an `@env.task` into a Claude in-process MCP tool.
- `flyteplugins.agents.claude.run_agent` — run the agent loop inside your task and return the answer.

The `claude-agent-sdk` wheel bundles the native `claude` CLI (no separate Node.js
install needed); set an Anthropic API key in the environment.
