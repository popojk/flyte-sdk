"""`run_agent` — run a Pydantic AI agent on Flyte.

Pydantic AI owns the agent loop. `run_agent` runs that loop inside your
`@env.task`: it drives an `Agent` whose tools are Flyte tasks, and returns
the final answer. Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action (its own
container/resources, with retries and caching).

Provide either a pre-built `agent` (with its tools already attached via
`Agent(tools=[...])`) or `tools` + `model` to have one built for you.

Observability: the run timeline is rendered into the Flyte task report.

    Args:
        input: The user prompt.
        tools: `tool`-wrapped tools or bare `@env.task` templates. Used only
            when no `agent` is passed; the built agent attaches them natively.
        agent: A pre-built Pydantic AI `Agent` (tools already attached).
            Mutually exclusive with `tools`.
        model: Model name (e.g. `"openai:gpt-4o"`) or `pydantic_ai` `Model`
            instance for the built agent. Required on the builder path (no default
            is assumed — the adapter is provider agnostic); ignored when a
            pre-built `agent` is given.
        instructions: System prompt / instructions for the built agent.
        name: Agent name (for debugging/observability).
        durable: Record/replay each model turn via `flyte.trace`. On the builder
            path the inferred model is wrapped in `FlyteModel`; on the prebuilt-
            agent path durability is applied via `agent.override(model=...)` when
            the agent's model can be obtained (best-effort otherwise).
        observability: Render the run timeline into the Flyte task report.
        memory_key: Stable id (e.g. a user/thread id) for cross-run memory. When
            set, prior conversation history is loaded from a durable, keyed
            `MemoryStore` and passed as `message_history=`; after the run the
            full history is saved back, so a later run with the same key continues
            the conversation. Best-effort — a memory failure never breaks a run.
        **run_kwargs: Additional kwargs forwarded to `agent.run` (e.g. an explicit
            `message_history=`, which takes precedence over loaded memory).

    Returns:
        The agent's final output as a string.
