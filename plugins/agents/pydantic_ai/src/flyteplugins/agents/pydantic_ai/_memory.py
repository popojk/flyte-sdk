"""Cross-run Pydantic AI memory — a thin handle over Flyte's keyed `MemoryStore`.

Pydantic AI keeps conversation state in-memory: each `Agent.run` returns a
result whose `all_messages()` is the full message history, and a follow-up run
continues the conversation by passing that history as `message_history=`. This
module bridges that onto a durable, keyed `flyte.ai.agents.memory.MemoryStore`
so a later run with the same `memory_key` resumes where the last one left off —
even on a different worker.

The message history is serialized with Pydantic AI's `ModelMessagesTypeAdapter`
(the SDK's own round-trip format) and stored in a single path-addressed JSON slot,
so it stays testable via the store's `read_json` / `write_json` API. All of it
is best-effort: a memory failure never breaks a run.
