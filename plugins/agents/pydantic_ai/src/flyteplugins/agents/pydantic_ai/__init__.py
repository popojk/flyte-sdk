"""Pydantic AI adapter for Flyte.

Bring your own Pydantic AI `Agent` and run it durably on Flyte. The adapter
provides:

- `flyteplugins.agents.pydantic_ai.tool` — turn a Flyte `@env.task` into a Pydantic AI tool that
  executes as a durable child action (own container/GPU, retries, caching).
  This is the shared `flyteplugins.agents.core.tool`: Pydantic AI accepts
  plain (async) callables in `Agent(tools=[...])` and infers each tool's
  schema from the callable's signature, which the core wrapper preserves.
- `flyteplugins.agents.pydantic_ai.run_agent` — run the Pydantic AI agent loop inside your task and return
  the final answer.

Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action, and the run timeline is
rendered into the Flyte task report.
