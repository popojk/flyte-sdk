"""Deep Agents adapter for Flyte.

Bring your own [Deep Agent](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview)
— LangChain's agent harness with built-in planning, a virtual filesystem, and
subagents — and run it durably on Flyte. The adapter provides:

- `flyteplugins.agents.deepagents.tool` — turn a Flyte `@env.task` into a LangChain `StructuredTool`
  (a `BaseTool`) that executes as a durable child action (own container/GPU,
  retries, caching). Attach it to the main agent or to a subagent.
- `flyteplugins.agents.deepagents.run_agent` — run the deep agent (a compiled `create_deep_agent`
  graph) inside your task and return the final answer. Either pass a pre-built
  `agent` or let it build one from `tools` + `model` + `instructions`
  (Deep-Agents options like `subagents=` pass through).
- `flyteplugins.agents.deepagents.DurableChatModel` — wrap any LangChain chat model so each model turn
  is recorded/replayed via `flyte.trace`; use it when building your own agent
  with `create_deep_agent(model=DurableChatModel(inner=...))`.

Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action, and the run timeline is
rendered into the Flyte task report. `memory_key` persists the conversation
*and* the agent's virtual filesystem across runs.
