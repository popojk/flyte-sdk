"""Cross-run Deep Agents memory — a thin bridge over Flyte's keyed `MemoryStore`.

A deep agent is driven with a messages state (``graph.ainvoke({"messages":
[...]})`) and also carries a virtual filesystem (the `files`` state its
built-in filesystem tools read and write). By default neither survives the run.
This module bridges both: it resolves a keyed `flyte.ai.agents.MemoryStore`, loads the
prior conversation and files from path-addressed JSON slots, and writes them
back after the run — so a later run with the same `memory_key` continues the
conversation *and* sees the same virtual filesystem.

The transcript is stored as `messages_to_dict(...)` output (rebuilt with
`messages_from_dict`); the files state is stored as its plain
`{path: contents}` dict. All operations are best-effort: any failure leaves
the run untouched (memory never breaks a run).
