"""`run_agent` — run a Hermes (`hermes-agent`) agent on Flyte.

Hermes owns the agent loop: its `AIAgent` (the `run_agent` top-level module
of the `hermes-agent` package) drives the model and dispatches tools from a
process-global registry. `run_agent` runs that loop inside your `@env.task`:
it builds an `AIAgent` scoped to exactly the Flyte-task tools you pass (via a
custom Hermes toolset), drives `AIAgent.run_conversation` (a blocking call,
bridged off the event loop with `asyncio.to_thread`), and returns the final
answer. Each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action (its own
container/resources, with retries and caching).

Observability: the run timeline is rendered into the Flyte task report.

The adapter minimizes delta between native Hermes code and Flyte integration:
bring your own pre-configured `AIAgent` (with `enabled_toolsets` including
`flyteplugins.agents.hermes.FLYTE_TOOLSET`) or let `run_agent` build
one from `tools` + `model`.

    Await this from an async task as `await run_agent(...)`; from a sync task
    use `flyteplugins.agents.hermes.run_agent_sync` instead.

    Call this from inside an `@env.task` — that task is the durable parent.
    Within it, each tool call runs as a durable Flyte child action. Give the
    enclosing task `retries=...` for self-healing and `report=True` to see
    the agent timeline.

    Provide either a pre-built `agent` (an `AIAgent` with its own
    `enabled_toolsets`) or `tools` + `model` to have one built for you.

    Args:
        input: The user prompt.
        tools: `tool`-wrapped tools or bare `@env.task` templates.
        agent: A pre-built Hermes `AIAgent`. Mutually exclusive with `tools`.
        model: Model name for the built agent. Required when `agent` is not
            given (there is no default model).
        instructions: System prompt. On the builder path this becomes the
            agent's `ephemeral_system_prompt`; with a pre-built agent it is
            passed as this run's `system_message`.
        name: Agent name (used for the scoped toolset and observability).
        durable: Accepted for the shared adapter contract, but currently a
            no-op for Hermes: `hermes-agent` exposes no per-model-turn hook
            (the model client is buried inside `AIAgent`), so completed model
            turns cannot be recorded/replayed via `flyte.trace` the way the
            openai/langchain adapters do. Tool calls are durable regardless —
            each runs as a Flyte child action with retries and caching — so a
            retried task still self-heals at tool granularity.
        observability: Render the run timeline into the Flyte task report.
        memory_key: Stable id (e.g. a user/thread id) for cross-run memory.
            When set, conversation history is persisted to a keyed `MemoryStore`
            and resumed on a later run with the same key (passed to Hermes as
            `conversation_history`).
        **agent_kwargs: Extra keyword arguments for the built `AIAgent`
            (e.g. `api_key=`, `base_url=`, `provider=`,
            `max_iterations=`). Only valid on the builder path. When none of
            `api_key`/`base_url`/`provider` are given and
            `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, the built agent is pointed at OpenAI
            with that key (Hermes otherwise only reads credentials from its own
            `hermes setup` config, which a fresh container doesn't have).

    Returns:
        The agent's final output as a string.
