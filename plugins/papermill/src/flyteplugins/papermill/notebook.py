    """Record output values from a notebook for use by downstream Flyte tasks.

    Call this as the **last expression** in a cell tagged `"outputs"`.
    The returned protobuf text is captured by Jupyter as the cell output
    and later extracted by `NotebookTask`.

    Values are serialized as Flyte Literals, so any type supported by
    Flyte's type system works — primitives, `File`, `Dir`,
    `DataFrame`, dataclasses, etc.

    Example (cell tagged `"outputs"`):

    ```python
    from flyteplugins.papermill import record_outputs

    record_outputs(result=42, summary="done")
    ```

    Args:
        **kwargs: Output name/value pairs.

    Returns:
        Protobuf text representation of a `LiteralMap`. Jupyter captures
        this as the cell's text/plain output.
